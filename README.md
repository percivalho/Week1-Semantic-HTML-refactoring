## 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Boot Camp Challenge Week 1:

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Features

Main Feature is using Semantic HTML Elements.
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  


* `<article>`
* `<aside>`
* `<footer>`
* `<header>`
* `<main>`
* `<nav>`
* `<section>`
